# Fine Pose - Cloud Programming Final Project

## Project Overview

Fine Pose is a web application designed to help users learn yoga safely by providing real-time pose recognition and correction. The application features a social component allowing users to create and join yoga challenges with friends, encouraging consistent practice through timely reminders and progress tracking.
